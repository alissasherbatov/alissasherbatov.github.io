    <h2>Student Advocacy Union</h2>
        <h3>Bergen County Academies Disorientation Guide (April 2022 - June 2022)</h3>
            <p>In 2019, I co-founded the Student Advocacy Union (SAU), an organization dedicated to fighting for the needs of the students of Bergen County Academies (BCA). As an organization, we have spoken at board meetings, started several petitions, created surveys and forms reaching 400+ students. During my time at Bergen County Academies, I oversaw SAU's Instagram account, which reached 9000+ accounts in just the last 6 months of my time in SAU.</p>
            <p>As one of our final projects, I and the rest of the graduating co-founders decided to create a website called the BCA Disorientation Guide. In it are all of the resources that we could have used when we were freshmen ourselves. The website is filled with advice (in the form of letters to our past selves), notes on how to access certain resources at BCA, and educative links to topics we wished we had learned about in health class (incl. LGBT-specific topics, interpersonal effectiveness, and neurodiversity).</p>
            <p>I was initially in charge of coding the site, though we've since added others to the development team to account for expansion and continuity. You can find the site <a target="_blank" href="https://bcaguide.github.io/">here</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies used: </strong>GitHub Pages, Jekyll, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

    <h2>HackBCA VI</h2>
        <h3>The Online Observatory (April 2022)</h3>
            <p>For my last year participating in my high school's hackathon, I wanted to create something related to my interest in environmental science. Specifically, I wanted to create a site to encourage people to fall back in love with exploring the Earth and keeping it safe, sustainable and beautiful. That's why I made a virtual globe to hold live surveillance feeds from locations around the world in one place, enabling users to view what's going on in many different places at a time. You may find the site <a target="_blank" href="https://rielsher.github.io/rielglobenew.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies used: </strong>GitHub Pages, Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook, Plotly, HTML, CSS</p>

    <h2>Bergen County Academies Physics Team</h2>
        <h3>Roller Coaster Visualization (January 2022)</h3>
            <p>As captain of Bergen County Academies' Physics Team, I wanted to take a few lectures to share my interest in roller coasters. As I was preparing my material for one of the lectures, I realized that I could combine roller coaster physics with some Python and turn the lecture into a coding lesson. The code linked <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alissasherbatov/coaster-loop">here</a> uses Euler's method to generate the shape of a roller coaster loop:</p>

            <h4>Roller coaster loop shape based on G-force value of 3 G's.</h4>
            
            </center>
            <p>A lot of the underlying physics behind the program is explained in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2W5SJc5j4">this video</a> by Art of Engineering. I highly recommend it!</p>
