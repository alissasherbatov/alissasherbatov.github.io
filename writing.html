    <h3>The Scream Formula: Into the Hidden World of Roller Coasters (November 2020 - June 2022)</h3>
    <p><em>ISBN-13: 979-8218014414</em></p>
    <p>The goal of The Scream Formula, published on June 2nd, 2022, is to educate people - ranging from those who don't know any physics to those with an extensive technical background - on roller coasters. With this book, I also wanted to showcase the breadth of fields that roller coaster studies touch, including math, robotics, biology, computer science and even anthropology.</p>
    <p>In addition to writing and formatting the book itself, I designed and produced its cover. As a bonus feature, the book features a curated list of roller coaster-related books and studies for those who would like a higher-level introduction. You may purchase the book and view more information on it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2TW9FN6?ref_=pe_3052080_397514860">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Design Thinking (July 2021 - April 2022)</h3>
    <p>Since April 2021, I have been an ambassador for Princeton IgniteSTEM, a club that organizes STEM education events. One of my projects as an ambassador was to co-write Design Thinking, a book of exercises that can be used by elementary/middle school teachers to expose students to engineering design. The goal with this book was to be able to introduce the students to a lot of complex concepts, including personalized learning, fusion energy, and mixed reality, which are some of the sections that I wrote exercises for. While itâ€™s not at all expected that the students will understand all the nuances of each topic (though I would have loved to explain tokamak physics to a fifth grader), the intention was to get the gears in their brains turning, and give them experience with the design process as a whole.</p>
    <p>This book is currently in the publishing process. In April 2022, I organized an event on Princeton's campus with the other ambassadors to serve as a demonstration of how the exercises would flow and function in a classroom setting. Hundreds of students from many different schools around New Jersey showed up.</p>
